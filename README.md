**Not functional until a few private packages are made public.

TODO:
1.  Clean up paths. Undecided about using github to import quick and dirty packages.
2.	Rewrite client with methods organized by type client and type server. This should improve code organization/cognition. And facilitate dynamic clients and improve server creation.

Objectives: 
Play with GO.
Multiple active clients with transparent history.
Minimize irc server interaction without sacrificing functionality.
Have https, terminal, linux, android and ios clients. (windows/osx?)
Have search/research capabilities in large clients. https/linux.

NOTES:
Not a priority.
Expect to see massive rewrites to test GO functionality and code organization.
