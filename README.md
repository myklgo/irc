IRC
client
server/bouncer
db/history

TODO:
1	Rewrite client with methods organized by type client and type server. This should improve code organization/cognition. And facilitate dynamic clients and improve server creation.
2	

Objectives: 
Play with GO.
Multiple active clients with transparent history.
Minimize irc server interaction without sacrificing functionality.
Have https, terminal, linux, android and ios clients. (windows/osx?)
Have search/research capabilities in large clients. https/linux.

NOTES:
Not a priority.
Expect to see massive rewrites to test GO functionality and code organization.
