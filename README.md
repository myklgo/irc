**Not functional until a few private packages are made public.

TODO:
1.  Clean up paths. Need to identify ethical means of using forked lib.
2.  Create protocol for User to Server.
3.  Implement history storage and make it transparent to User.

Objectives: 
Play with GO.
Multiple active clients with transparent history.
Minimize irc server interaction without sacrificing functionality.
Have https, terminal, linux, android and ios clients. (windows/osx?)
Have search/research capabilities in large clients. https/linux.

NOTES:
Not a priority.
Expect to see massive rewrites to test GO functionality and code organization.
